        <p style="font-size:16px;">This project took a deeper look at the problems that arise with hegemony in the context of technology sectors, and the obstacles that lie with companies selecting candidates solely based on meritocracy. This project takes a look at intersectionality, and specifically how certain groups with specific cultural backgrounds have unfair advantages within the technology section when compared with minorities. </p>

<p style="font-size:16px;">Several problems, which specifically disadvantage minorities, arise when few companies dominate a technology sector. First, there is a lack of diversity among the companies operating in a specific market, as smaller and more diverse companies are unable to compete against larger and more established companies. Second, when large established companies take over a technology sector, there is often less competition, which leads to higher prices, which disadvantages lower class individuals. This could also lead to less innovation, which would cause there to be fewer options to choose from, which again is a disadvantage for lower class individuals.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;">There are also several potential problems that occur when companies hire employees solely based on meritocracy. There could be limited diversity as a result of meritocratic systems, as the system emphasizes individual merit and achievement rather than diversity and inclusion. As a result, there is a lack of representation for certain groups including but not limited to women, people of color, and individuals with disabilities. Second, we would have to make sure that the evaluators do not have implicit biases in the employment process, as this could also disadvantage groups with different cultural backgrounds. Third, a meritocratic system may disadvantage lower class individuals, as these individuals may not have had access to a better education or connections, as compared to individuals with money. The “Achieving Meritocracy in the Workplace” article confirms the disadvantages certain groups face with a meritocratic system. “When managers believe their company as a whole is meritocratic, they may become less vigilant about their individual actions, leading them to unintentionally make biased decisions” (Castilla, 36).</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;">It may be difficult to recognize implicit disadvantages that occur within certain processes, but this project helped me become more aware of certain issues individuals might face. Here are some problems that individuals might be facing when collaborating on code together. </p>

<p style="font-size:16px;">1. An individual may have slower/no WIFI, and they may not have access to the same technological resources that other individuals in the team have.<br>
2. An individual might have more time commitments than other individuals, so they are not able to spend as much time on the project. Additionally, it can be hard to coordinate a time where all group members are free. </p>

	<p style="font-size:16px;">Projects, such as these, are always useful in helping me understand the privilege I have when working in a collaborative environment. I have never thought about how nice it is to have access to a quiet environment, a fast and reliable network connection, and a laptop. Additionally, I am able to pick the hours I work every week, which makes it easy for me to be available for group meetings.</p>
