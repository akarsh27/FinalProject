      <article>
        <p style="font-size:16px;">The topic we decided on for this project was hegemony, specifically in the technology sector, and meritocratic systems in the technology industry. Our survey consisted of questions regarding the two topics. The goal of our survey was to help individuals become more aware of the implicit biases they may have regarding these two topics. </p>

        <p style="font-size:16px;">When we first created our survey, we assumed that the only audience that would be taking this survey would be individuals that are in this class, and already know the definitions of hegemony and meritocracy. We didn’t think about individuals who don’t already know the definitions of these terms, so when we received feedback that we should include a brief description of the meanings of these terms, we added that. We also got some feedback that even with individuals knowing the definitions of hegemony and meritocracy, some of our questions were a bit difficult to understand due to the grammar and the content itself of the question. To fix this, we thought about the different ways individuals could have opinions/answer our questions, and we were able to word our questions differently to account for everyone's answers. </p>
 

				<p style="font-size:16px;">Understanding the website's aims and objectives was crucial to the design process. We had to think about what we wanted the site to do and how the target audience would gain from it. This aided in our decision-making about the questions and findings we would provide, as well as the general design and structure of the website.</p>

				<p style="font-size:16px;">The user experience was yet another essential factor. We worked hard to ensure the website had a clear framework, was simple to use and was straightforward to navigate. Using colors, fonts, and visuals that the target audience would find aesthetically attractive, we also paid close attention to the website's design.</p>

				<p style="font-size:16px;">In addition to these design components, we also had to consider the site's technological requirements. This included utilizing responsive design to make sure the site was suitable for desktop devices and making sure the site was effective by using the right code techniques.</p>

				<p style="font-size:16px;">We created our survey using google forms, and embedded that onto our website. We thought this would be a good idea because users are able to see the average responses of individuals that have taken our test at the end of completing our survey. Users can then see how their responses compare to the average response.</p>

				<p style="font-size:16px;">At the time of writing this, 55% of our test takers were male, and 45% were female. About 55% were straight as well. Most individuals thought that the tech industry prospers in a hegemonic environment. As a result, most agree that the government should not regulate dominating technology companies to preserve competition with less dominating companies. In the second topic, meritocracy, the majority believed that companies favor male and white employees. They also believed that accountability and transparency is necessary in a meritocratic system. An observation our group made was that a lot of the majority answers were neither agree nor disagree, and this could be because individuals did not have enough background knowledge about the topic to formulate an opinion.</p> 

				<p style="font-size:16px;">To improve our test, our group agreed that we should have more users take our survey so some of the majority answers are not neither agree nor disagree, and create a scale with point systems to better analyze our results.</p>
 
				<p style="font-size:16px;">All things considered, creating a multipage website with questions, results, and other pages requires a careful and systematic approach. We were able to develop a valuable and efficient resource by considering the demands and objectives of the target audience and the website's user experience and technical components.</p>
