        <p style="font-size:16px;">We focused our survey website on hegemony and meritocracy. Through the questions we asked in our survey we are able to see how aware people are of the discrimination that can come from these systems. According to Castilla in “Achieving Meritocracy in the Workplace?”, he has found, from studying workplace inequality and merit-based pay, “that such approaches are no protection against demographic bias. When managers believe their company is a meritocracy because formal evaluative and distributive mechanisms are in place, they are in fact more likely to exhibit the very biases that those systems seek to prevent.” </p>

<p style="font-size:16px;">It is important to know if people are aware of this happening in the tech industry because it is a topic that needs more awareness. Although the meritocratic system might appear like a good thing as it focuses on only the skills someone has for the job and doesn’t focus on gender, race, physical ability, etc. This could also be harmful because as Castilla states these biases they have might come out subconsciously and lead  to them creating a work environment that is not diverse at all. This can limit the opportunities that are given to minorities. </p>

<p style="font-size:16px;">It is hard to think about how these issues can be found in the environment we worked in because it is not the same as a company. However, I think the two biggest things that could cause trouble when it comes to working remotely in a group is time and technology. There could be a difference in time zones, or schedules, someone might be free when another person starts work. This can make it harder to set up a good live discussion about the project and even though texting and emailing are still options I feel those can be hard to communicate everything in the way you would like. The other issue that is very common is technology issues whether someone does not have access to a laptop or a certain website or the connection could just be very bad when trying to zoom. </p>

<p style="font-size:16px;">The meritocratic system could be a good system to work with if people are fully aware of the possible unconscious bias that they could be experiencing and putting out. There needs to be transparency and accountability in order for the system to work. I feel both hegemony and meritocracy are important topics for people to continue learning about. I think this survey and its results are a good start to spreading that awareness. </p>
