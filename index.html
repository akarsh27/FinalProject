      <article>
        <p>Welcome to our LIS 500 final project, which includes a survey, results, and analysis on hegemony.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this survey is to measure bias regarding hegemony, meritocracy, and gender roles in the technology sector, all topics we learned about and discussed in class.</p>

        <p>Recall, <b>hegemony</b> is defined as: the idea of control and domination by ruling elites, oligarchies or fascist regimes over the masses. In the context of the technology sector, this would refer to the dominance of a group of executives over others, or a particular company or group of companies over others in the industry.

        <p><b>Meritocracy</b> is defined as: the ideology that skills and hard work, rather than background and social status, are what an organization or society upholds as its highest value. In technology, this would include companies hiring, promoting, and rewarding based on ability and merit.</p>

        <p>Try to keep these definitions in mind as you take the survey.</p>
